\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_music_group}{Music\+Group}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Handles a Playlist that\textquotesingle{}s in the form of nodes in a scene tree. ~\newline
 Each Music\+Group node must have a node as a direct child named "{}\+Music"{} that lists the directory (folder) paths of songs in its metadata. ~\newline
 The metadata has to list each song\textquotesingle{}s folder in this format\+: ~\newline
 Entry name\+: {\ttfamily songN} where N represents the numerical index of the song package directory starting from 1. Songs are played in numerical order. ~\newline
 Entry value\+: The absolute path to the song\textquotesingle{}s directory. (The value\textquotesingle{}s type must be string.) \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_music_player}{Music\+Player}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Plays music that is split into playlists (see Playlist) ~\newline
 This class applies a fade transition when the user wants to switch between playlists. ~\newline
 Each instance of a Music\+Player can only play one song at a time at most. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_music_zone}{Music\+Zone}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represents a single music zone. ~\newline
 Music zones each have their own playlist. Such playlists typically only contain one song, but it\textquotesingle{}s possible for the playlists to have multiple songs. ~\newline
 To specify the geometry that makes up the music zone, the music zone has to have a node named "{}\+Zone\+Parts"{} as a direct child. This "{}\+Zone\+Parts"{} node should contain Mesh\+Instance3\+Ds using box meshes (preferred for performance reasons) or CSGBox3\+Ds. These boxes make up the music zone\textquotesingle{}s geometry. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_music_zone_player}{Music\+Zone\+Player}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Music\+Player that handles the playback of Playlists with music zones in mind. ~\newline
 Music zone logic is handled like how it is in Juke\textquotesingle{}s Towers of Hell. This means that whenever a player enters a music zone, the zone\textquotesingle{}s playlist gets played. ~\newline
 In order for music to play when the player is outside a music zone, a primary playlist must be set. This playlist will get played when outside of the music zones. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_playlist}{Playlist}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represents a musical playlist that can hold multiple Songs. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_song}{Song}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represents a single song associated with a file, along with some metadata. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_song_changed_args}{Song\+Changed\+Args}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Event arguments for Playlist.\+Song\+Changed and Music\+Player.\+Song\+Changed \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_song_info_file}{Song\+Info\+File}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Reads the associated "{}info.\+txt"{} file for a song. ~\newline
 The contents of such types of files should be formatted like this\+: ~\newline
 {\ttfamily  property name\+: property value } ~\newline
 where each property is specified on its own line. ~\newline
 Currently, the properties read for an song\textquotesingle{}s info.\+txt file are\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item name\+: The name of the song 
\item artists\+: The artists that made the song 
\item album\+: The album the song belongs to 
\item audio\+\_\+path\+: The file path to the audio file, including its file name and extension 
\end{DoxyItemize}This text formatting is inspired by the way that the content of .osu files are formatted in Osu (the rhythm game). \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_music_1_1_song_package}{Song\+Package}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represents a folder (such as one on the filesystem) that contains a song and its info metadata. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
