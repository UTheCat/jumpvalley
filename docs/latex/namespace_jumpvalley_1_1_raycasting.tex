class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_raycasting_1_1_raycast_sweep}{Raycast\+Sweep}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Sweeps over a region of 3D space using a series of equally-\/spaced-\/out raycasts. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The center raycast, being located in the middle (or close to it), is assigned to the greatest integer that\textquotesingle{}s less than or equal to the median index. "{}index"{} here refers to the numerical index that a raycast is located in within a raycast sweep from left to right. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_raycasting_1_1_raycast_sweep_result}{Raycast\+Sweep\+Result}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Class that contains data about the result of a raycast sweep operation (where collisions with a Raycast\+Sweep\textquotesingle{}s raycasts are checked). \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
