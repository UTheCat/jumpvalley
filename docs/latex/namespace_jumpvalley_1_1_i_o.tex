class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jumpvalley_1_1_i_o_1_1_info_file}{Info\+File}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Reads an Info file, a blob of text that\textquotesingle{}s primarily for defining metadata for a specific object, such as an audio file or a level. The blob of text typically comes from a plain-\/text file named "{}info.\+txt"{}. ~\newline
~\newline
 The contents of such types of files should be formatted like this\+: ~\newline
 {\ttfamily  property name\+: property value } ~\newline
 where each property is specified on its own line. ~\newline
 For the property name, spaces should be replaced with underscores. The property name and property value should be split with a "{}\+: "{}, including the space and not including the quotes. ~\newline
~\newline
 This text formatting is inspired by the way that the content of .osu files are formatted in Osu (the rhythm game). \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
