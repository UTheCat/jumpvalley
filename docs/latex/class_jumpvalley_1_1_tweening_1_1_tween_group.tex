A class capable of overseeing multiple tweens as a "{}group"{}. ~\newline
 It offers support for storing tweens in a key-\/value map (also called a Dictionary$<$\+TKey, TValue$>$) and doing various operations with all of the tweens in the map at once. ~\newline

 Please note\+: In order for this to work, an instance of Tween\+Group$<$\+TKey$>$ must be parented to a Godot node of some sort (preferably one that will be in the scene tree until the application exits). This is due to the Godot limitation that Tweens must be in the scene tree in order to be processed.
