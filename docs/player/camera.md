# The Player's Camera

Just like in Juke's Towers of Hell, the player's camera should be able to be controlled in three modes:

- First person
- Third person without Shiftlock
- Third person with Shiftlock

Here's a rough outline of how this would be implemented.

## Shiftlock

Shiftlock, also known as Camera-lock or Mouse-lock, is a type of third-person camera that makes the player's character always face in the direction that the camera is facing. If the player is playing with a trackpad or mouse, their cursor gets locked at the center of their screen while Shiftlock is enabled.

In Jumpvalley, this is toggled by pressing Left-Shift on a keyboard. If Jumpvalley ends up supporting mobile, there will be a button on the user's screen for this on mobile devices too.
