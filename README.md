# Jumpvalley

This is a 3D-platformer made with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) based on the hardcore platformer, [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell). Yes, this means you will not need to be connected to the internet while playing an obstacle course that runs on Jumpvalley!

Currently, it's a work in progress. A lot of basic features, like being able to load other obstacle courses (other than the ones present when you first load the game), as well as various level mechanics such as jump pads, have yet to be implemented.

Though if you want to test it, it is playable. There's currently a small obstacle course you can try out. For the most part, the control scheme is the same as the one in Juke's Towers of Hell (with the main exception being the ability to ladder-boost as done in [Flood Escape 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/738339342/Flood-Escape-2)).

**Important:** While it is currently possible to make an obstacle course in Jumpvalley with the Godot Editor, backwards-compatibility is subject to being broken while Jumpvalley is still in major version zero (0.x.x). This is because level behavior hasn't been set in stone yet. If you want to prevent your level from being broken between minor versions, please wait until Jumpvalley has reached major version one (1.0.0).

## Credits

The ```addons``` folder contains assets made by 3rd-parties. They're super useful in this project because not only do I not have the skill, time, and/or resources to make a lot of these assets, but they also allow me to speed up development and testing using resources that the creators of these assets have allowed others to use.

A list of such assets can be found [here](https://github.com/UTheDev/jumpvalley/blob/main/credits.md).

## Getting started with the project itself

This project is currently being made using the .NET-Enabled version of Godot v4.2.1.

If you'd like to open the Godot project file (```project.godot```), make sure to download a copy of .NET-Enabled Godot v4.2.1 [here](https://godotengine.org/download).

Once finished (or if you already downloaded it), run .NET-Enabled Godot v4.2.1 and open your copy of this repository's ```project.godot``` file.

In order to run the project, there's a play button near the top-right corner of the window. Click it to run the project.
