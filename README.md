# test_godot_game

This is my attempt at learning Godot by trying to recreate various parts of [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell) (JToH) in Godot.

```res://addons/studs.dds``` is the set of studs textures that comes from Roblox and is the primary texture set used in JToH.

This project is a work in progress.
