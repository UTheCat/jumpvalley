# Jumpvalley
This project is my attempt at learning Godot by trying to recreate various parts of [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell) (JToH) in Godot.

Currently, it's a work in progress. Though if you want to test it, it is currently in a somewhat playable state.

## Credits
The ```addons``` folder contains assets made by 3rd-parties. They're super useful in this project because not only do I not have the skill, time, and/or resources to make a lot of these assets, but they also allow me to speed up development and testing using resources that the creators of these assets have allowed others to use.

A list of such assets can be found [here](https://github.com/UTheDev/test_godot_game/blob/main/credits.md).

## Licensing
This project's source code is licensed under the MIT License. The source code's license can be found [here](https://github.com/UTheDev/test_godot_game/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

Assets under the ```addons``` folder are covered by different licenses (especially since they were made by other individuals).

## Getting Started
This project was made using Godot v4.0.3.
If you'd like to open the Godot project file (```project.godot```), make sure to download a copy of Godot v4.0.3 [here]().

<small>As of writing this, I've just been informed that Godot 4.1 released today. Hopefully the migration goes well.</small>
