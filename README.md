# Jumpvalley
This is a 3D-platformer made with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) based on the hardcore platformer, [Juke's Towers of Hell](https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell). Yes, this means you will not need to be connected to the internet while playing an obstacle course that runs on Jumpvalley!

Currently, it's a work in progress. A lot of basic features, such as a menu, being able to load other obstacle courses, and climbing have yet to be implemented.

Though if you want to test it, it is playable. There's currently a small obstacle course you can try out. For the most part, the control scheme is the same as the one in Juke's Towers of Hell.

## Credits
The ```addons``` folder contains assets made by 3rd-parties. They're super useful in this project because not only do I not have the skill, time, and/or resources to make a lot of these assets, but they also allow me to speed up development and testing using resources that the creators of these assets have allowed others to use.

A list of such assets can be found [here](https://github.com/UTheDev/test_godot_game/blob/main/credits.md).

## Licensing

Assets under the ```addons``` folder are covered by different licenses (especially since they were made by other individuals).

## Getting started with the project itself
This project is currently being made using the .NET-Enabled version of Godot v4.1.1.
If you'd like to open the Godot project file (```project.godot```), make sure to download a copy of .NET-Enabled Godot v4.1.1 [here](https://godotengine.org/download).

Once finished (or if you already downloaded it), run .NET-Enabled Godot v4.1.1 and open your copy of this repository's ```project.godot``` file.
